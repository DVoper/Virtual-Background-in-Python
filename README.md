# Virtual Background in Python
Do you want to create a virtual background like ZOOM in Python??
Well that's what I have for you today

The installations are as follows:

pip install opencv-python==4.2.0.32

pip install cvzone==1.3.5

Make sure to play around with the threshold value in line 29 and the fps value

Thank You!!!
